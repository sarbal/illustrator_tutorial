## Results figures
Watch this space! 

### Pick your panels 
- Less is more. 

### Build your figure 
- It should have a narrative flow. 
- This to this to this to that. 
- Can build up (example result -> summary stat example -> summary of all results) 
- Most salient point needs to be shown. 
- Don't add extra colors if they don't mean something. Add colors if they represent discrete entities. Gradients for continuous data. 
- Be consistent.
